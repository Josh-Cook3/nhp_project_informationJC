Data is sourced from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) Admitted Patient Care (APC) dataset.
We extract spell level data for a given year.

## Pre-processing

### Last episode in spell

We use the last episode in spell, but the field `SPELEND` has issues where some admissions end up with multiple episodes
having a `SPELEND` flag assigned. This would lead to an inflated amount of admissions in our model if left as is.

We generate a new indicator for last episodes in spell by using the field `SUSSPELLID` and the `EPIORDER` fields.
For each `SUSSPELLID`, we assign a `ROW_NUMBER()` ordered by `EPIORDER` in descending order.
If there are multiple records with the same `EPIORDER`, only one record will be selected as the last episode in spell.

### Age

In the model we join to other datasets by age. However, these other datasets cap out at different ages, with the
lowest-common denominator being 90 years.
Anyone aged over 90 is assigned to have an age of 90.

The age field in HES encode's the age of neonatal patients with values over 7000.
In these cases we set the age to 0.

### Provider code

Over time, some NHS organisations merge.
This information is provided in the [organisation successors][ods_succ] from the Organisation Data Service (ODS).

[ods_succ]: https://digital.nhs.uk/services/organisation-data-service/export-data-files/csv-downloads/miscellaneous

We use the successors lists to map historical data to the current organisation.
For example, if provider `A` merged with provider `B` in 2023, when we extract data from 2019 we would remap any data
for `A` to `B`.

## Filtering

We select records where the `SEX` is either 1 or 2 (Male/Female). This causes some records to be lost where the sex is
not known, or is neither male or female. However, the population growth part of the model depends upon this field having
one of the two stated values above.

We select the last episode in spell, determined in the pre-processing step.

We select records where `WELL_BABY_IND='N'`. That is, we filter out well-baby records. Rows where there is a value of
'Y' are new-born babies who are healthy and not requiring any medical interventions.

## Derived fields

### `group`

We determine the group based on the `admimeth` field.

- if it starts with a `"1"`, then `"elective"`
- if it starts with a `"3"`, then `"maternity"`
- otherwise, "`non-elective`"

### `has_procedure`

- if there is a procedure code that does not start with U, V, W, X, Y, or Z, then `1`
- otherwise, `0`

### `hsagrp`

- if the `classpat` field is either `3` or `4`, then `"reg"`
- if the `admimeth` field is either `"82"` or `"83"`, then `"birth"`
- if the `mainspef` field is `"420"`, then `"paeds"`
- if the `admimeth` field starts with `"3"` and the age is less than `56`, then `"maternity"`
- if the `mainspef` is either `"501"` or `"560"`, and the age is less than `56`, then `"maternity"`
- if the `admimeth` field starts with a `"2"`, then `"emerg"`
- if the `admimeth` field is `"81"`, then `"transfer"`
- if the `admimeth` field begins with a `"1"`, and the `classpat` is `"1"`, then `"ordelec"`
- if the `admimeth` field begins with a `"1"`, and the `classpat` is `"2"`, then `"daycase"`

### `tretspef`

If the `tretspef` is in the list of RTT specialties[^RTT], then leave as is, otherwise, set it to:

- if the `group` (see above) is `"maternity"`, then `"Maternity"`
- if it starts with a `"1"`, but isn't `"180"`, `"190"`, or `"192"`, then `"Other (Surgical)"`
- if it is `"560"`, then `"Other"`
- if it is `"180"`, `"190"`, `"192"`, `"831"`, `"833"`, or `"834"`, then `"Other (Medical)"`
- if it starts with a `"2"`, "`3"`, "`4"`, "`5"`, "`6"`, then `"Other (Medical)"`
- otherwise, `"Other"`

[^RTT]: For a complete list see page 40 of the NHS England [*Recording and reporting referral to treatment (RTT) waiting times for consultant-led elective care* guidance](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/20231020-Recording-and-Reporting-guidance-October-2023-Choice-Update-Final.pdf).

### `mainspef`

We use `mainspef` to map to KH03 data. Any codes that do not map to the specialties in KH03 would cause a problem, so
the following table is used:

| old  | new |
| ---- | --- |
| 199  | 100 |
| 499  | 300 |
| 560  | 501 |
| 600  | 300 |
| 601  | 141 |
| 902  | 141 |
| 903  | 141 |
| 904  | 141 |
| 950  | 300 |
| 960  | 300 |
| NULL | 300 |
| &    | 300 |

### `is_wla`

We derived whether this is a waiting list admission based on whether the `admimeth` field is `"11"`
