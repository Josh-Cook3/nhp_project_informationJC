## Data sources

The data sources utilised in the model are listed below.

The model uses the pseudonymised, hospital event-level dataset known as [Hospital Episode Statistics](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics) as its primary source of information about hospital activity in the baseline period. The dataset contains detailed administrative, demographic, geographic and clinical information about NHS-funded hospital events.  These data are supplied for use by NHS Digital.  The use of the data is dictated by a Data Sharing Agreement.
