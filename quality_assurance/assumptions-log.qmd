title: "Assumptions Log"
---

The purpose of an assumptions log is to justify any decisions made about the data and methodologies used. 

Our assumptions log has the following columns

- ID: Unique reference for our assumptions
- Description: Short description of the assumption and link to the justification and evidence for the assumption
- Quality rating: Excellent, Good, Poor
- Impact rating: Low, Medium or High
- Risk rating: Determined by quality rating and impact rating

This project website is version controlled and therefore historical versions of the assumption log can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_project_information).


```{r, echo = FALSE}
assumptions <-
  jsonlite::fromJSON("assumptions.json") |>
  tibble::as_tibble()

# check_assumptions_log(file) # Asserts that the columns are correctly formatted and that the risk rating is correctly calculated

  dplyr::select(-Link) |>
  reactable::reactable(
    columns = list(
      # Using htmltools to render a link
      Description = reactable::colDef(html = TRUE, cell = function(value, index) {
        sprintf('<a href="%s" target="_blank">%s</a>', assumptions$Link[index], value)
      }),
      `Quality rating` = reactable::colDef(cell = function(value) {
        class <- paste0("tag status-", tolower(value))
        htmltools::div(class = class, value)
      })
    )
  )
```
