title: "Quality assurance"
---

Quality Assurance is an important part of the NHP model.
As we role out model updates we are constantly reviewing and updating our QA work.

The QA work within the project is described in workstream 3 of the 23/4 MOU as:

> Light-touch sense-checking as well as more formal, comprehensive QA of model code and high-priority outputs when required. This will include a requirement for full QA of outputs for all... Cohort 4 hospitals with contingency for lighter-touch QA throughout the process

In order to quality assure the model and outputs there are three main components that need to be quality assured:

- The data on which the model run is based, as well as the parameters input into the model
- The actual model code
- The outputs of the model code

- [QA log](https://github.com/orgs/The-Strategy-Unit/projects/6/views/2)
- [Assumptions log](/quality_assurance/assumptions-log.qmd)
- Previous versions of the model code are version controlled and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit). You can view an overview of the [repository structure](/software_implementation/assumptions-log.qmd)
- The code is documented with 100% test coverage.

Some items on the QA plan & log are associated with private repositories.
We are working towards making these repositories public.
