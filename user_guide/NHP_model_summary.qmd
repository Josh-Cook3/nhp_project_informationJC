# What does the NHP model do?

In a nutshell, the NHP model estimates future hospital activity. To do this, it uses as its basis activity from a baseline year (2019/20).

Users provide input parameters, estimating the probability of whether specific types of activity will increase or decrease. Other change factors are also taken into consideration, such as demographic and non-demographic growth.

The model runs a '**principal model run**' which takes as its parameters the midpoint of all the parameter estimates. So for example if the estimated expatriation of inpatient elective opthalmology activity is 80% - 100%, the model will take the value of 90% for this parameter for the principal run.

It will then run as many Monte Carlo simulations as have been selected by the user (usually 256). During these Monte Carlo simulations, the parameters will be randomly sampled from the confidence intervals provided, assuming a normal distribution. So for example if the estimated expatriation of inpatient elective opthalmology activity is 80% - 100%, some runs might take 80% as the value for this parameter, and some might take 100% as the value for this parameter. Most runs will take values somewhere in the middle, however.

More detail on how the parameters are applied to individual records from the baseline data is [available here](../modelling_methodology/modelling_uncertainty.qmd).

After each model run we get estimated future hospital activity. The numerous runs that happen during the Monte Carlo simulations are summarised to give an overall estimation of likely future activity.
